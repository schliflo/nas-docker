You need to have the following environment variables setup or replaced in your `docker-compose.yml` and your storage mounted in `/mnt/storage/cloud` and `/mnt/storage/shares` for nextcloud and plex respectively.

(you need to have correct DNS records set for the domains you want to use and probably setup port forwarding of ports 80 and 443 to your nas in order to get remote access and let's encrypt working)

## Setup
1. Make sure to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.
1. You also need to have some sort of dynamic DNS setup to your (public) IP. Point the Domain(s) you are using to this IP.
1. Add a static rule to your router for the system you are running this on, so the (private) IP doesn't change. Then forward ports `80` and `443 to this IP
1. Clone the repo to `/opt`
1. Run `docker-compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml up -d`
1. Services should be available at the hosts specified in your environment. 

## Shares
As I wanted to have certain directories directly accessible in my network, I created a user `shareuser`, which owns the shared dir and used the following config for `/etc/samba/smb.conf`:
```
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  server string = nas
  security = user
  guest ok = yes
  map to guest = Bad Password

  log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
  max log size = 50
  printcap name = /dev/null
  load printers = no

# Samba Shares
[nas]
  comment = Storage on NAS
  path = /mnt/storage/shares
  browseable = yes
  public = yes
  writeable = yes
  create mask = 0644
  directory mask = 0755
  force user = shareuser
```
*You will need to restart samba for config changes to take effect*
